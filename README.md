The last 20 years I have been a freelance system maintenance IT expert in Ethiopia, mainly working for Dutch horticulturests and farmers.
Now I am retired I want to pick up some old skills I learned in the 90ties like coding.
Picking up  the new languages, python and it's developments in django and kivy.
And getting grip on virtual environments, git, docker, things that are quite new to me.
Also the HTML and CSS have changed so my knowledge needs te be renewed. 
Getting to know the 'cloud' with instances at Google, Oracle, Azure and Github.
And lately looking into AI using Ollama.
